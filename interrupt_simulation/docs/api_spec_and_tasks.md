## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
manim==0.10.0
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required.
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No API spec required as this is a standalone simulation program.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the simulation. It creates the interrupt table and computer, and starts the simulation."),
    ("computer.py", "Implements the Computer class. This class has methods to run the computer, handle interrupts, and interact with the interrupt table."),
    ("interrupt_table.py", "Implements the InterruptTable class. This class has methods to add and remove interrupts.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "interrupt_table.py",
    "computer.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'computer.py' and 'interrupt_table.py' should be implemented first as they contain the core functionality of the simulation. 'main.py' is dependent on these two files and should be implemented last.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points at this moment. However, we need to ensure that the simulation is visually clear and easy to understand. We also need to ensure that the code for the simulation is contained within a single class, which will require careful planning and organization of the code.
