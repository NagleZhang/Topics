## Implementation approach
We will use Manim Community Edition, an open-source animation engine, to create the simulation. The difficult point is to create a visually clear and easy-to-understand simulation of a computer with an interrupt table. We will need to design the animation in a way that clearly shows the interrupt table and how the computer responds to interrupts. We will also need to ensure that the code for the simulation is contained within a single class, which will require careful planning and organization of the code.

## Python package name
```python
"interrupt_simulation"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "computer.py",
    "interrupt_table.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Computer{
        +dict interrupt_table
        +bool is_running
        +__init__(interrupt_table: dict)
        +run()
        +interrupt_handler(interrupt: str)
    }
    class InterruptTable{
        +dict table
        +__init__()
        +add_interrupt(interrupt: str)
        +remove_interrupt(interrupt: str)
    }
    Computer "1" -- "1" InterruptTable: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant C as Computer
    participant I as InterruptTable
    M->>I: create interrupt table
    M->>C: create computer with interrupt table
    M->>C: run computer
    C->>I: add interrupt
    C->>C: interrupt handler
    C->>I: remove interrupt
    C-->>M: end simulation
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
