    ("script.py", "Contains the Script class. Responsible for storing the text and scenes of the video."),
    ("animation.py", "Contains the Animation class. Responsible for creating and managing the animations in the video."),
    ("video_controls.py", "Contains the VideoControls class. Responsible for managing the video controls (play, pause, rewind, fast-forward)."),
    ("keyboard_input_example.py", "Contains the KeyboardInputExample class. Responsible for demonstrating how an interrupt is triggered when a key is pressed and how the operating system handles this interrupt."),
    ("test.py", "Contains the tests for the program. Responsible for ensuring that all components of the program work as expected.")

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'main.py' file is the main entry point for the program. It is responsible for orchestrating the creation of the script, animations, video controls, and keyboard input example.

The 'script.py' file contains the Script class, which is responsible for storing the text and scenes of the video.

The 'animation.py' file contains the Animation class, which is responsible for creating and managing the animations in the video.

The 'video_controls.py' file contains the VideoControls class, which is responsible for managing the video controls (play, pause, rewind, fast-forward).

The 'keyboard_input_example.py' file contains the KeyboardInputExample class, which is responsible for demonstrating how an interrupt is triggered when a key is pressed and how the operating system handles this interrupt.

The 'test.py' file contains the tests for the program. It is responsible for ensuring that all components of the program work as expected.

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me. However, we need to ensure that all team members are familiar with the Manim and MoviePy libraries, as they will be heavily used in this project. If necessary, we can arrange a training session to get everyone up to speed.
