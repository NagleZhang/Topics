## Original Requirements
The boss has requested the creation of a video that uses a keyboard as an example to describe how operating system interrupts work. The video should be created using Manim.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create an educational video explaining operating system interrupts",
    "Use keyboard inputs as a practical example in the video",
    "Utilize Manim to create engaging and informative animations"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a computer science student, I want to understand how operating system interrupts work so I can apply this knowledge in my studies",
    "As a software developer, I need a clear and concise explanation of operating system interrupts to improve my coding efficiency",
    "As a visual learner, I appreciate the use of animations to explain complex concepts",
    "As a user, I want to be able to pause, rewind, and fast-forward the video so I can learn at my own pace",
    "As a user, I would like the video to use practical examples, like keyboard inputs, to help me better understand the concept"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Computerphile's 'Interrupts' video: Provides a basic explanation but lacks visual aids and practical examples",
    "Crash Course Computer Science's 'Operating Systems' video: Covers a wide range of topics, including interrupts, but may be too broad for users seeking a focused explanation",
    "Khan Academy's 'Computer Science' course: Offers comprehensive coverage of many topics, but may be too in-depth for users wanting a quick understanding of interrupts",
    "Code.org's 'How Computers Work' series: Engaging and informative, but does not cover interrupts in detail",
    "Coursera's 'Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User' course: Provides a deep dive into operating systems, including interrupts, but requires a time commitment",
    "Udemy's 'Operating System Concepts' course: Detailed and thorough, but requires payment",
    "YouTube's 'Operating System Interrupts Explained' video: Free and accessible, but lacks visual aids and may not be engaging"

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a video that explains the concept of operating system interrupts using the example of keyboard inputs. The video should utilize Manim to create engaging animations that aid in understanding the concept.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Create a script for the video that clearly explains operating system interrupts", "P0"),
    ("Design animations using Manim that visually represent the concept of interrupts", "P0"),
    ("Incorporate the example of keyboard inputs into the video to provide a practical understanding", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the video has controls for pausing, rewinding, and fast-forwarding", "P1"),
    ("Test the video on multiple platforms to ensure compatibility and accessibility", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The video should have a clean and minimalistic design, with the focus being on the animations and the information being presented. The animations should be clear and concise, using simple shapes and colors to represent different components of the operating system and the interrupt process. The video controls should be intuitive and easy to use, located at the bottom of the video player.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
